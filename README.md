## README Generator

## Description

This application uses JavaScript, Node, and Inquirer to allow the user to create their own README files automatically.

## Usage

To use this app, cd into the correct working directory and then input "node index.js". The user will then be walked through several questions involving the contents of their README file to be. Namely, the title, usage information, installation instructions, contributors, included tests, licenses, and contact information.
